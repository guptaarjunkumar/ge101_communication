	 <h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; font-family:Bookman Old Style; color:brown;">The post and spread of mass communication</h1>
	 <p style="font-size:24px; font-family:Forte;">Messages carved on stone pillars communicate very well across time, down through the centuries, but they are an inefficient method of communicating across space. The message reads only within reading range; its recipients must travel to receive it. The system is altogether more efficient if it is the message which travels. 
There are forms of long-distance communication not based on words. The smoke signals used by American Indians (above all perhaps in westerns) are of this kind. So are bonfires lit in succession on a line of hilltops. But such devices are only capable of conveying very limited pre-arranged signals, such as 'danger' or 'victory'. 
The sending of written messages is a standard feature of government in early civilizations. Much of our knowledge of those times derives from archives of such messages, discovered by archaeologists. 
There is great advantage to a ruler who can send or receive a message quicker than his rivals. In the estimation of the ancient world the most efficient postal service is that of the Persians. Put in place by Cyrus in about 540 BC to control his new empire, the largest yet known, it is much improved upon by Darius a generation later. 
Imperial communication: 522-486 BC
Darius extended the network of roads across the Persian empire, to enable both troops and information to move with startling speed. At the centre of the system was the royal road from Susa to Sardis, a distance of some 2000 miles (3200 km). At intervals of a day's ride there were posting stations, where new men and fresh horses used to be available at any moment to carry a document on through the next day's journey. By this method a message can travel the full distance of the road in ten days, at a speed of about 200 miles a day.

<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; font-family:Bookman Old Style; color:brown;">Pigeon post: from the 11th century<h1>
<p style="font-size:24px; font-family:Forte;">Domesticated pigeons were first developed in ancient Egypt. In Baghdad, in the 11th century, the idea first occurs of making use of the tendency of certain pigeons to fly straight home from wherever they may be. 
A rapid one-way postal service (always back to base) became possible. By selective breeding of suitable birds, the homing pigeon was developed. The swiftest and most wide-ranging conqueror of medieval history, Genghis Khan, saw the obvious potential. Pigeons used to carry swift news of each new conquest to his homeland in Mongolia.

But the rapid and widespread dissemination of a message awaited the development of printing. 
The spread of printing: 1457-1500
An invention as useful as printing, in a Europe of increasing prosperity, readily finds new customers. 
The first Italian press was founded in 1464, at the Benedictine town of Subiaco in the papal states. Switzerland too had a press in the following year. Printing began in Venice, Paris and Utrecht in 1470, in Spain and Hungary in 1473, in Bruges in 1474 (on a press owned by Caxton, who moved it to London in 1476), in Sweden in 1483. By the end of the century the craft was well established in every European kingdom except Russia.

<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; font-family:Bookman Old Style; color:brown;">From incunabula to mass communication: 1457 - 1525</h1>
	 <p style="font-size:24px; font-family:Forte;">In the first half-century of European printing the book rapidly displaces the the manuscript of earlier generations, providing equal elegance at less cost. Printed books of the 15th century are known as incunabula (Latin for the 'cradle' of printing). Though very rare now, incunabula were surprisingly numerous then; 1700 presses in some 300 towns are estimated to have produced about 15 million volumes by 1500. 
The profusion of presses in Europe by the early 16th century means that the machinery is in place for a different and entirely new form of production - the rapid printing of pamphlets, or even single sheets, which can be used in a war of propaganda. 
This potential lies dormant until an unexpected opportunity arises. It comes through an intellectual controversy of unprecedented violence - the Reformation. After Luther's challenge to the Roman Catholic church, the printing presses feed and fan the flames. Pamphlets fly in all directions. The printed page finds a new role as an arena of almost instant debate. The 'press' acquires a new and significant meaning.
