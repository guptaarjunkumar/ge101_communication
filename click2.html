	 <h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Cave paintings (Around 63,00BC)</h1>
	 <p style="font-size:24px; font-family:Forte;">The most well-known form of primitive communication is cave paintings. The method involved creating pigments made from the juice of fruits and berries, colored minerals, or animal blood. These pigments were then used to create depictions of primitive life on the cave walls. The purpose of the paintings has been questioned by scholars for years, but the most popular theory states that the depictions were used as a manual for instructing others what animals were safe to eat. 
The most common subjects in cave paintings are large wild animals, such as bison, horses, aurochs, and deer, and tracings of human hands as well as abstract patterns, called finger flutings. The species found most often were suitable for hunting by humans. Drawings of humans were rare and are usually schematic as opposed to the more detailed and naturalistic images of animal subjects.
In three caves scattered across Spain, researchers found more than a dozen examples of wall paintings that are more than 65,000 years old. The cave paintings and are the first works of art dated to the time of Neanderthals. Neanderthals (or Neandertals) are our closest extinct human relatives. In 1856, limestone quarry workers in Germany's Neander Valley found bones that at first seemed to belong to a deformed human. Scientists of the time soon concluded that the large-browed, barrel-chested figure belonged to a distinct hominin species: Homo neanderthalensis.
 


At the time, Neanderthals were considered more brawn than brains, with one scientist even suggesting that they be classified as Homo stupidus. But according to the findings, Neanderthals appear to have had a cultural competence that was shared by modern humans.
