	 <p style="font-size:24px; font-family:Forte;">During the early 1900’s, a new form of communication and entertainment took the world by storm. What began as short-wave communication used during WWI blossomed into the hottest communication technology of the era once the war had ended. Amateur broadcasting began around 1914, commercial broadcasting didn’t hit the air waves until 1920. Radio was unregulated until 1925 when the Federal Communications Commission stepped in. At this point, approximately 2 million homes had radios and there were several hundred stations broadcasting thousands of programs. The technology advanced so fast that new radios were obsolete withing 3-6 months.
Radios were incredibly popular during the late 1920’s and early 1930’s due to the Great Depression and also the “flapper” movement. The American people loved to dance, and most other forms of entertainment were too expensive. The technology really took off in 1933 when Edwin Armstrong, “the father of FM radio”, invented frequency-modulated radio. By the 1940’s, the number of radios in American homes had doubled, and 800,000 FM receivers were produced in 1947.
