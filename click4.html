	 <h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; font-family:Bookman Old Style;">The discovery of paper: AD 105</h1>
	 <p style="font-size:24px; font-family:Forte;">Chinese tradition attributes one of the most wide-reaching of inventions to a eunuch at the imperial court, by the name of Cai Lun, in the year AD 105. 
Cai Lun may merely have presented the emperor with a report on the new substance, but certainly paper was produced in China in the second century AD. Fragments of it survive, made from rags and the fibres of mulberry, laurel and Chinese grass. 
 To make a sheet of paper these substances are repeatedly soaked, pounded, washed, boiled, strained and bleached. The mush is left to drain in a mesh frame and then dried. The result is thinner and more flexible than previous materials used for writing purposes, and much more adaptable to methods of large-scale production. 
This desirable secret took 1000 years to reach Europe. 
 The slow journey westwards: from AD 751
Some Chinese paper-makers were captured by Arabs in a battle of 751. The captives were put to work in Samarkand. From there the technology was taken to Baghdad and it continued to spread slowly westwards through the Muslim world, until it reached Spain in the 12th century. 
Most handwritten manuscripts were written on vellum as paper was not widely available back then. The majority of books and documents written were of a religious nature. This was due to the fact that writing a religious piece was viewed as a form of worship, and also that most books were written by monks in monasteries. Literacy rates were incredibly low during the time of handwritten books, and few citizens had time for pleasure reading. Only the monks and the very wealthy were given the opportunity to become literate.   Two important periods stand out when one is investigating early books. The time between the 7th and 13th centuries was considered the age of the religious manuscript. The 13th century, however, brought about exciting change in the realm of the written word. For the first time, secular books were produced for the sake of spreading knowledge not relating to religion.
In 1448, a man named Johann Gutenberg revolutionized the way books were made forever. An inventor born in Germany, Gutenberg had a vision of a device that would utilized movable type using blocks with pre-printed text. This method, combined with the use of paper, ink and a printing press allowed for books to be mass-produced, and greatly reduced the price. Gutenberg made his first device by adapting a wine press to remove the water from paper after printing.   Gutenberg’s initial project with his new invention was a reprint of a Latin speech book. When this was a success, he embarked on his most famous printing project- the printing of the Gutenberg bibles. His were the first bibles printed in Europe. Gutenberg’s invention took awhile to catch on as the bourgeoisie of the day still wanted to keep the peasants uneducated.
 

Paper was common in Europe by the 15th century. It was therefore available for the first European printed books. 
 From rags to wood pulp: 19th century
Until the 19th century rags were the main ingredient of paper, and books of earlier periods still had white and flexible pages, pleasant to read even today, centuries later. 
But various developments in the 19th century (increasing population, more prosperity, wider education, the steam press) lead to ever greater demand for paper. The supply of rags could no longer meet the need. 
 	 Paper-makers first try esparto grass as a substitute. Then it was discovered - in Maine and Massachusetts in the 1860s - that wood can be pulped and turned into paper (the first newspaper to be printed on paper from wood pulp was the Boston Weekly Journal in January 1863. The mass market is satisfied and has continued to be satisfied by this new source of material. But posterity will be less well served. 
But paper from wood pulp soon turns yellow and brittle. Many books of the late 19th century were now in an unreadable condition, falling to bits, and books of our own time will follow even more rapidly down the same path. 
But by this time paper recycling and electronic publishing has arrived to make sure that there are no worries about the retention of past records.
