	 <p style="font-size:24px; font-family:Forte;"></p>
	 <h2 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; font-family:Bookman Old Style; color:brown;">Analog Cellular Networks or “1G”</h2>
	 <p style="font-size:24px; font-family:Forte;">The first generation of cellular networks paved the way to the networks we know and use today. Use of multiple cell tower sites, each connected through a network, allowed users to travel and even switch cell towers during a call. It was a revolution built on existing, analog technology with the first being built in Chicago in 1977.
Known as the Analong Mobile Phone System (AMPS), it was built by AT&T and it took the FCC 11 years to approve AT&T’s initial proposal in 1971 before they were assigned the 824-894MHz range on which to operate AMPS.
Hot on the heels of the western researchers were Japanese telecommunications company NTT who built their own network in 1979. Five years later it was the first 1G network to cover an entire country. Then came the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) network in 1981. Operating in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway, it was the first to feature international roaming</p>
	 <h2 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; font-family:Bookman Old Style; color:brown;">Digital Cellular Networks or “2G”</h2>
	 <p style="font-size:24px; font-family:Forte;">As technological advancement picked up the pace, so did mobile phones. The 1990s saw the arrival of two new, digital technologies – the European GSM standard and the North American CDMA standard. Demand grew and more and more cell tower sites were built. In addition to technological improvements in batteries and internal components, this allowed for much smaller mobile devices.
Another advancement made possible by 2G was the introduction of SMS messaging, with the first computer generated SMS sent in 1992 in the UK. A year later in Finland, the first person-to-person SMS was delivered using GSM technology. As popularity grew, pre-paid mobile phones and plans emerged in the late 1990s which further popularized SMS amongst all ages.

The very first download services were also introduced using 2G technology and enabled users to download ringtones. Mobile phones also saw use as another method of payment for services like car parking in Finland and vending machines.

	 <h2 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; font-family:Bookman Old Style; color:brown;">Mobile Broadband or “3G”</h2>
	 <p style="font-size:24px; font-family:Forte;">NTT DoCoMo pioneered the first mobile Internet service in Japan in 1999 on existing 2G technologies, but it was soon replaced with their launch of the world’s first 3G network in October 2001. Many countries followed suit in the following years including South Korea, the US and the first European 3G networks which sprang up in the UK and Italy in 2003.

While 3G was still being developed a number of “2.5G” services appeared in an attempt to bring older technologies up to speed. Unfortunately speed was the lacking factor, and while technologies like GPRS and EDGE provided improvements over standard 2G, they did not match the speed of existing 3G technologies.
3G transformed the mobile phone industry and enabled widespread mobile Internet and the transmission services like TV and Radio for the very first time. Handset manufacturers jumped on the bandwagon and smartphone use took off. By around 2005 3G had evolved a step further, leading many to coin the terms “3.5G” “turbo 3G” and “3G+” in reference to HSPDA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), HSPA and HSPA+.

	 <h2 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; font-family:Bookman Old Style; color:brown;">Native IP or “4G”</h2>
	 <p style="font-size:24px; font-family:Forte;">While no official standards exist for 4G, a few technologies have laid claim to the title. The first was WiMAX, offered by Sprint in the US but perhaps the most successful has been LTE, which is popular also in North America but non-existent in some territories such as Australia. 4G marks the switch to native IP networks, bringing mobile Internet more in-line with wired home Internet connections. 
Speed is of course the big advantage, with potential advancements of ten times over 3G rates. The fourth generation of mobile communication is still evolving, and we’re bound to see new standards, speed increases and coverage benefits in the next few years.
