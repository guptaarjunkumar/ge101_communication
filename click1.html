	 <p style="font-size:24px; font-family:Forte;">The earliest stone tools in archaelogical records are securely dated to 2.5 million years ago. By contrast, the timing for the origin of speech is highly debated. Dates suggest range between 2million and 50,000years ago. That's a huge span and a clear motivator for further research.About 1.75 million years ago, our human ancestors, achieved a technological breakthrough. They began to craft stone tools hand axes in ways that required required more planning and precision that had been used in earlier tool-making processes. Around the same time pre-historic people began to talk. In other word, tool making and language skills evolved together.
That is the conclusion of a research published in 2013 by archaelogist Natalie Thais Uomini and psychologist Georg Friedrich Meyer. This is a rather provocative study where Uomini and Meyer's approach was to measurepatterns of brain activation in modern people as they demonstrated both linguistic and technological skills, which share what is called "the need for structured and hierarchal action plans". The authors decided to seek direct evidence that both skills draw on common brain areas or result in common brain activation and thus made the conclusion.
